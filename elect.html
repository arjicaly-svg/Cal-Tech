        <h1>Electrical and Electronics Technology</h1>
        <p>Electrical and Electronics Technology is the branch of technology that deals with the study and application of electricity, electrical machines, and electronic devices. It helps us understand how electricity is produced, transmitted, controlled, and used to power different appliances and machines in our daily lives.</p>
        <p>Electricity is a vital part of modern living because it is used for lighting, cooking, heating, communication, transportation, and industrial processes. Electronics, on the other hand, deals with smaller currents and voltages used in devices like radios, televisions, mobile phones, and computers.</p>
        <h2>Difference Between Electrical and Electronics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>	Electrical Technology deals with the generation, transmission, and use of large amounts of electrical power (e.g., power stations, transformers, electric motors).</li>
            <li>	Electronics Technology deals with the control of small electric currents for information processing, communication, and automation (e.g., computers, phones, calculators).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Sources of Electricity</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>	Primary Sources:
Hydroelectric power (water)
,Thermal power (coal, oil, gas)
,Nuclear power
,Solar power
&Wind energy
</li>
            <li>	Secondary Sources:
	Batteries (chemical energy converted into electricity)
,	Generators (mechanical energy converted into electricity
</li>
        </ul>
<h1>Basic Electrical Components</h1>
<ul>
    <li>	Resistors – Limit the flow of electric current.</li>
    <li>	Capacitors – Store and release electrical energy.</li>
    <li>	Diodes – Allow current to flow in one direction only.</li>
    <li>	Transistors – Act as switches or amplifiers.</li>
    <li>	Transformers – Step up or step down voltage.</li>
    <li>	Switches – Used to turn circuits on or off.</li>
    <li>	Fuses and Circuit Breakers – Protect circuits from overload or short-circuit.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Types of Electric Current</h2>
<ul>
    <li>	Direct Current (DC): Flows in one direction only (e.g., from batteries).</li>
    <li>	Alternating Current (AC): Changes direction back and forth (used in homes and industries).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Applications of Electrical and Electronics Technology</h2>
<ul>
    <li>	In Homes: Lighting, fans, refrigerators, televisions, pressing irons.</li>
    <li>	In Schools: Projectors, laboratory equipment, computers.</li>
    <li>	In Industry: Electric motors, welding machines, control systems.</li>
    <li>	In Communication: Radios, televisions, mobile phones, internet.</li>
    <li>	In Transport: Electric trains, traffic lights, electric cars.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Safety in Electrical and Electronics Technology</h2>
<ul>
    <li>	Always switch off appliances before repairing.</li>
    <li>	Never handle electrical equipment with wet hands.</li>
    <li>	Use correct fuse or circuit breaker rating.</li>
    <li>	Do not overload sockets.</li>
    <li>	Ensure proper earthing/grounding</li>
    <li>	Use insulated tools when working with electricity.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Electric Wiring</h2>
<p>Electric wiring is the process of connecting electrical components together in order to distribute electricity safely in homes, schools, or industries.</p>
<h3>Types of Wiring Systems</h3>
<ul>
    <li>	Cleat Wiring – Wires fixed on wooden cleats, used temporarily.</li>
    <li>	Casing and Capping Wiring – Wires run inside wooden or plastic casing for protection.</li>
    <li>	Conduit Wiring – Wires are passed through metal or PVC pipes, very safe and neat.</li>
    <li>	Flexible Cord Wiring – Used for portable appliances like pressing irons, lamps, or radios.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Basic Wiring Tools</h3>
<ul>
    <li>	Pliers</li>
    <li>	Screwdrivers</li>
    <li>	Wire strippers</li>
    <li>	Tester</li>
    <li>	Hammer and nails</li>
</ul>
<h3>Common Wiring Accessories</h3>
<ul>
    <li>	Switches</li>
    <li>	Sockets</li>
    <li>	Lamp holders</li>
    <li>	Junction boxes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Troubleshooting in Electrical and Electronics Technology</h2>
<p>Troubleshooting is the process of finding and fixing problems in electrical and electronic systems.</p>
<h3>Steps in Troubleshooting</h3>
<ul>
    <li>	Observation – Look for signs such as sparks, smoke, or unusual sounds.</li>
    <li>	Testing – Use a tester or multimeter to check for faults.</li>
    <li>	Isolation – Identify the faulty part (e.g., blown fuse, bad switch, burnt resistor).</li>
    <li>	Repair or Replace – Fix the damaged part or replace it with a new one.</li>
    <li>	Retesting – After repair, test the system again to ensure it works properly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Common Electrical Faults</h3>
<ul>
    <li>	Blown fuse or tripped circuit breaker.</li>
    <li>	Loose connections.</li>
    <li>	Short circuits.</li>
    <li>	Burnt-out bulbs.</li>
    <li>	Faulty switches or sockets.</li>
</ul>
