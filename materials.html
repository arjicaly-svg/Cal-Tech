        <p>Materials are substances or resources found in our environment, which are used to make things that are useful to us. They are the foundation of all human production and engineering. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The chair we sit on is made from wood or plastic,</li>
            <li>The roofing sheets above our heads are made from metal,</li>
            <li>The spoon we use to eat may be made from stainless steel (metal) or wood,</li>
            <li>Cars, trains, airplanes, and buildings are all constructed using different types of materials.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Wood</h2> 
    <p>Wood is an engineering material that comes from trees. It has been one of man’s oldest building and crafting resources. In almost everything man builds, wood is used in one part or another.</p>
    <h3>Types of Wood</h3>
    <p>There are two main types of wood:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hardwood – Comes from broad-leaved trees (like mahogany, iroko, or oak). It is usually strong and durable. Example: school desks, house doors, railway sleepers.</li>
        <li>Softwood – Comes from needle-leaved trees (like pine and cedar). It is lighter, easier to cut, and often used for furniture and paper production. Example: classroom chairs, paper, and matchsticks.</li>
    </ul> 
    <h3>Properties of Wood</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>They appear either dark or light in color.</li>
        <li>They are poor conductors of heat, which is why wooden handles are used in cooking pots.</li>
        <li>Magnets do not attract wood.</li>
        <li>They are poor conductors of electricity when dry. Example: Electricians often use dry wood as support in their work.</li>
        <li>When polished, wood looks shiny (e.g., polished office tables).</li>
        <li>They are useful in making furniture, hand tools, vehicle parts, roofing, and houses.</li>
        <li>Wood makes dull or low sounds when wet.</li>
        <li>Wood can absorb shock or impact (e.g., wooden cricket bats, wooden hammers used in carpentry).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Metals</h2>
    <p>Metals are solid, shiny materials obtained from natural minerals like iron ore. They are important engineering materials because they are strong, durable, and good conductors of heat and electricity.</p>
    <h3>Types of Metals</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1.	Ferrous metals:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Contain iron and are magnetic.</li>
            <li>Examples: Steel (used for bridges and skyscrapers), Razor blades, Nails, Car bodies.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>2.	Non-ferrous metals:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Do not contain iron and are non-magnetic.</li>
            <li>Examples: Aluminium (used in pots, roofing sheets), Copper (used in electrical wires), Cast iron (used for machine parts and cooking pots).</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Alloys of Metals</h2>
    <p>An alloy is a mixture of two or more metals (sometimes with non-metals) to produce a new, stronger, or more durable material.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ferrous alloys: Mixtures of ferrous metals (metals containing iron).
Example: Carbon + Steel + Tungsten = High-speed steel (used in cutting tools).
</li>
        <li>Non-ferrous alloys: Mixtures of non-ferrous metals.
Examples:
</li>
<ul>
    <li>Copper + Tin + Aluminium = Bronze (used for medals, statues, and bells).</li>
    <li>Copper + Zinc = Brass (used for musical instruments, door handles, and decorations).</li>
    <li>Aluminium + copper + manganese =Duralumin</li>
</ul>
    </ul> 
    <h3>Properties of Metals</h3>
    <p>When identifying metals, we look at their properties:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1.	Toughness: They don’t bend, stretch, or break easily (e.g., steel in car bodies).</li>
        <li>2.	Malleability: They can be hammered into sheets (e.g., aluminium roofing sheets).</li>
        <li>3.	Fusibility: They melt when subjected to heat (e.g., iron melted in a furnace).</li>
        <li>4.	Density: They feel heavy when lifted (e.g., iron rod vs. plastic pipe).</li>
        <li>5.	Ductility: They can be stretched into thin wires (e.g., copper wires in electricity).</li>
        <li>6.	Brittleness: Some metals break instead of bending (e.g., cast iron pot).</li>
        <li>7.	Magnetism: Some metals (like iron and steel) are attracted to magnets.</li>
        <li>8.	Conductivity: All metals conduct heat and electricity (e.g., electric kettle, cooking pot).</li>
        <li>9.	Hardness: They resist scratching (e.g., stainless steel cutlery).</li>
        <li>10.	Elasticity: Some metals stretch slightly and return to their shape (e.g., springs made from steel).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ceramics</h2>
    <p>Ceramics are materials made mainly from clay.They are shaped and hardened by heating to very high temperatures. Glass is also similar to ceramics, but the way it is produced is different
</p>
<h3>Properties of Ceramics</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1.	Brittleness – Ceramics can break easily when dropped on a hard surface.</li>
    <li>2.	Heat resistant – They do not burn in fire and do not conduct heat.</li>
    <li>3.	Inorganic – Made from non-living raw materials like silicon (sand), sillimanite, and sulphur.</li>
    <li>4.	Non-sonorous – They do not produce loud or ringing sounds when struck.</li>
    <li>5.	Poor conductors of electricity – Electricity cannot pass through them.</li>
    <li>6.	Water resistant – They do not absorb water.</li>
    <li>7.	Refractory – Some ceramics can change the direction of light or heat.</li>
    <li>8.	Shiny nature – They may appear glossy, sparkling, or mirror-like.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Plastics</h2>
<p>Plastics are man-made materials obtained from two main sources:</p>
<ul>
    <li>1. Petroleum – produces thermoplastics.</li>
    <li>2. Chemical reactions – produce thermosetting plastics.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Properties of Plastics </h3>
<ul>
    <li>1.	Very light in weight, they can float on water.</li>
    <li>2.	Poor conductors of heat and electricity.</li>
    <li>3.	They never decay or rust.</li>
    <li>4.	They can be melted and remolded into new shapes.</li>
    <li>5.	They can be bent or folded into different shapes.</li>
    <li>6.	They are tough and don’t cut easily when stretched.</li>
    <li>7.	When stretched, their length increases only slightly.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rubber</h2>
<p>Rubber, like plastics, comes from two sources:</p>
<ul>
    <li>1.	Natural rubber – obtained from latex, a liquid tapped from a special tree called Hevea.</li>
    <li>2.	Synthetic rubber – made from chemical processes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Properties of Rubber</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1.	Elastic – can stretch up to twice its normal length. </li>
    <li>2.	Can return to its original length after stretching.</li>
    <li>3.	Poor conductor of heat and electricity.</li>
    <li>4.	Very good at absorbing shock or impact.</li>
    <li>5.	Highly water-resistant.</li>
    <li>6.	Can appear in colors such as dark reddish, yellow, or white.</li> 
</ul>
<h2>Glass</h2>
<p>•	Glass is a type of ceramic.It is made mainly from sand, lime, potash, soda, and lead oxide. These raw materials are mixed, melted in a furnace, and then shaped into useful objects.
</p>
<h3>Properties of Glass</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1.	Breaks very easily (brittle). </li>
    <li>2.	Poor conductor of heat and electricity.</li>
    <li>3.	Does not rust or decay.</li>
    <li>4.	Water resistant – water cannot pass through it.</li>
    <li>5.	Made from inorganic materials (e.g., silicon).</li>
    <li>6.	Non-metallic – does not show metal properties.</li>
    <li>7.	Hard to touch.</li>
    <li>8.	Transparent – we can see through it.</li>
    <li>9.	Not elastic (unlike rubber and plastics).</li>
</ul>
