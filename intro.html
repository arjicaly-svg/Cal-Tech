    <p>Technology is the use of scientific knowledge to solve human problems and make life more comfortable.
The word technology comes from two Greek words:
Tekhnē – meaning art or craft.
Logia – meaning study or science.
So, technology literally means “the science or study of crafting.”
</p>
<p>Technology includes both the processes (methods) and products (materials) that make life easier and less stressful. It is the practical use of scientific knowledge to create tools and machines that help people meet their needs</p>
<ul>
    <li>When we apply science to solve other people’s problems, it is called technology.</li>
    <li>When we apply science to solve our personal problems, it remains science, not technology.</li>
</ul></section>
