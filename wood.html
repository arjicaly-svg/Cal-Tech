        <P>Woodwork technology is the study and practice of working with wood to create useful items such as furniture, doors, windows, shelves, and many other materials. It is one of the oldest human crafts because wood has been used for shelter, tools, and decoration since ancient times. Today, woodwork technology is important not only for carpentry and furniture-making but also for teaching creativity, accuracy, and problem-solving skills.</P>
        <p>Woodwork begins with identifying and selecting wood. Woods can be divided into two main groups:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>	Hardwoods – examples include mahogany, iroko, and oak. They usually come from broad-leaved trees and are generally stronger and more durable</li>
            <li>	Softwoods – examples include pine and cedar. They come from cone-bearing trees and are lighter and easier to cut, though not always as strong as hardwoods.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Before using wood, it must be properly seasoned. Seasoning means drying the wood so that it does not warp, shrink, or crack after being used.
Tools are also very important in woodwork. Some of the common tools include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>	Saws (for cutting wood)</li>
    <li>	Hammers (for driving nails)</li>
    <li>	Planes (for smoothing surfaces)</li>
    <li>	Chisels (for shaping and carving)</li>
    <li>	Measuring instruments (like rulers, squares, and gauges)</li>
</ul>

<section id="saftey"><h2>Safety in Woodwork</h2>
<p>Safety is crucial when working with wood. Students must wear protective gear, handle sharp tools carefully, and keep the workshop clean and organized.</p>
<p>A major aspect of woodwork is learning how pieces of wood are joined together. This brings us to woodwork joints. A joint is the place where two or more pieces of wood are connected. The strength and beauty of any wooden structure depend largely on the type of joint used. Some common woodwork joints include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>•	Butt joint – the simplest type, where two pieces of wood are joined end-to-end or at right angles, usually strengthened with nails or screws.</li>
    <li>•	Lap joint – one piece of wood overlaps another, making it stronger than a butt joint.</li>
    <li>•	Mortise and tenon joint – one of the strongest and oldest methods, where a projection (the tenon) on one piece fits into a hole (the mortise) in another.</li>
    <li>•	Dovetail joint – strong and attractive, shaped like a bird’s tail; commonly used in drawers and boxes.</li>
    <li>•	Mitre joint – formed by joining two pieces cut at an angle (often 45°); often used in picture frames.</li>
    <li>•	Housing joint – made by cutting a groove in one piece of wood so that another fits tightly into it.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, woodwork technology teaches us how to select, prepare, and use wood effectively. It also trains students in creativity, accuracy, and safety in handling tools. Woodwork joints are very important because they determine the strength and durability of wooden projects. Understanding these basics gives students the foundation for becoming skilled in carpentry, joinery, or even advanced furniture design in the future.</p>
