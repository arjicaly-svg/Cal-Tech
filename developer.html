        <p>Welcome to our learning hub for Basic Technology! Behind this vision is Arji Calistus Chukwujekwu, a passionate teacher, researcher, and lifelong learner who believes that every young mind can build, create, and innovate if given the right knowledge and guidance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arji is a graduate of Technical Education (Electrical/Electronics Option) from Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka. His thirst for knowledge and commitment to technical education led him to pursue a Master’s Degree in Technology at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN). Currently, he is advancing his expertise even further as he works toward a Doctorate Degree in Technology at UNN.</p>
        <p>As someone who has walked the same learning path, he understands the challenges students face in understanding science and technology subjects. This is why he created this platform – to make Basic Technology fun, simple, and accessible to all junior secondary school students.</p>
        <p>Through this website, students can explore exciting areas such as:</p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>Automobile Technology – learning how cars and engines work.</li>
            <li>Electrical and Electronics Technology – discovering the power of electricity and gadgets.</li>
            <li>Woodwork Technology – working with wood and understanding carpentry.</li>
            <li>Metalwork Technology – learning about metals, tools, and fabrication.</li>
            <li>Building Construction – understanding how houses and structures are designed.</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>Mr. Arji believes that technology is not just about machines – it is about problem-solving, creativity, and preparing for the future. His dream is to inspire a new generation of Nigerian students who will become inventors, engineers, builders, and innovators that the world will celebrate.</p>
