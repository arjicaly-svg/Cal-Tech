        <h1>WORKSHOP SAFETY</h1>
        <p>A workshop is a room or building where machines, tools, and equipment are used to produce, repair, or maintain useful items.</p>
        <p>In a workshop:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Human beings use hand tools (like hammers, screwdrivers, spanners) and machine tools (like drilling machines, lathes, and saws) to do their work.</li>
        <li>These tools and machines do not have brains. They cannot think for themselves, so if they are not handled carefully, they can be dangerous to the people using them.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>Whenever a machine or tool injures someone, damages property, or even causes death, we call that an accident.</p>
       <p>Definition of an Accident: An accident is any unexpected and unfavorable event that causes injury, death, or damage to property.</p>
       <p>Since accidents can happen anytime, people try their best to reduce them as much as possible. That is why it is important to study and practice workshop safety.</p>
       <h2>Causes of Accidents in the Workshop</h2>
       <ul>
        <li>Taking Shortcuts</li>
        <p>This is when someone looks for a faster way to finish a job without following the proper method.
Example: A student tries to cut a piece of wood without clamping it properly because “it will only take a second.” The wood slips, and he gets injured.
</p>
<li>Fatigue (Tiredness)</li>
<p>Working when you are tired reduces concentration.
Example: A tired student continues to use a filing machine after sports practice. Because he is weak, he slips and hurts his hand.
</p>
<li>Overconfidence</li>
<p>Feeling too sure of yourself and thinking nothing can go wrong.
Example: A student who has used the soldering iron many times ignores the safety gloves. He accidentally burns his fingers.
</p>
<li>Preoccupation (Lack of Focus)</li>
<p>When your mind is occupied with personal problems, you lose concentration.
Example: A student thinking about an argument with a friend is distracted while using a saw, leading to injury.
</p>
<li>Poor Knowledge of the Machine</li>
<p>Using a machine without proper training or instruction.
Example: A new student switches on the lathe machine without knowing how to stop it. This could cause a serious accident
</p>
<li>Liquid on Surfaces</li>
<p>Wet or oily floors, tools, or handles can cause slipping or loss of grip.
Example: A student steps on an oily patch in the workshop and falls near sharp tools.
</p>
<li>Untidy Workshop</li>
<li>Hazardous Materials</li>
<li>Ignoring Safety Rules</li>
<li>Attempting Risky Challenges</li>
<li>Emotional Imbalance</li>
<li>Costly Mistakes</li>
<li>Poor Planning</li>
       </ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Accidents in workshops happen when people fail to follow rules, lose focus, or misuse machines and tools. By keeping the workshop clean, following safety instructions, and staying focused, most accidents can be avoided.</p>       
<h1>Types of Workshop Accidents</h1>
<p>Accidents can happen in many ways inside the workshop. Below are common types with examples students can relate to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Stepping on Sharp Objects</li>
    <li>Injuries from Faulty Machines</li>
    <li>Attacks from Corrosive Substances</li>
    <li>Electrocution</li>
    <li>Suffocation</li>
    <li>Falling from a Height</li>
    <li>Toxic Gas Emission and Inhalation</li>
    <li>Ear and Eye Problems</li>
    <li>Fire Outbreak and Injuries</li>
</ul>
<h2>Types of Fire Accidents</h2>
<p>Fires in workshops can be classified into three types:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Electrical Fire</li>
    <P>Caused by sparks, faulty wiring, or burning electrical accessories.
Example: A socket overloaded with plugs catches fire.
</P>
<li>Liquid Chemical Fire</li>
<p>Caused by flammable liquids such as petrol, kerosene, or diesel.
Example: A student pours petrol near a source of heat and it catches fire.
</p>
<li>Solid Materials Fire</li>
<p>Caused by easily flammable objects like paper, cloth, or wood.
Example: Sawdust in a workshop ignites from a small flame.
</p>
</ul>  
</body>
<h2>Safety Rules and Regulations in the Workshop</h2>
<p>The following rules should always be obeyed to prevent accidents:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Listen carefully to instructions before using machines or equipment.</li>
    <li>Do not play or joke in the workshop—machines are dangerous and not your mates.</li>
    <li>Always know where safety devices (fire extinguisher, sand bucket, etc.) are kept.</li>
    <li>Wear your safety materials (overall, boots, helmet, goggles, etc.) at all times.</li>
    <li>Ensure there is enough space around you before using machines.</li>
    <li>Never start a machine without first learning how to stop it.</li>
    <li>Keep clothing and body parts away from moving machine parts.</li>
    <li>Avoid being in a hurry; rushing leads to mistakes.</li>
    <li>Handle sharp hand tools carefully.</li>
    <li>Read and obey all safety signs, posters, and notices displayed in the workshop.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Workshop Safety Gadgets and Devices</h2>
<p>These are special items designed to protect workers and prevent accidents:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Overall – Protects the body from scratches and bruises, and gives a smart appearance.</li>
    <li>Boots – Protect the feet from sharp objects, hot liquids, and corrosive chemicals.</li>
    <li>Goggles – Protect the eyes from sparks, dust, bright light, and flying particles.</li>
    <li>Hand Gloves – Protect hands from cuts, corrosive chemicals, and mild electric shocks.</li>
    <Li>Helmet – Protects the head from falling objects or collisions.</Li>
    <li>Safety Belt – Used when working at heights to prevent falls. </li>
    <li>Ear Pad – Protects the ears from loud or harmful sounds.</li>
    <li>8.	Bucket of Sand – Used to fight fire if a fire extinguisher is not available.</li>
    <li>9.	Fire Extinguisher – Used to put out different types of fire.</li>
    <li>10.	Thick Blanket – Used to cover and put out fire on a person’s body or small items.</li>
    <li>11.	Fire Alarm – Alerts people to danger in the workshop.</li>
    <li>12.	Bills, Signs, and Posters – Give instructions on safety procedures and emergency exits.</li>
    <li>13.	CCTV Cameras – Monitor activities in the workshop to detect dangers early.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: If a student’s clothes catch fire, using a thick blanket can quickly smother the flames. If sparks ignite petrol, a bucket of sand or extinguisher should be used immediately.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Accidents in workshops may include cuts, burns, falls, shocks, or fire.</li>
    <li>Fires can be caused by electricity, chemicals, or solid materials.</li>
    <li>Following safety rules and using safety devices prevents accidents and saves lives.</li>
